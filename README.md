# Micro-Frontends-and-Microservices-Architecture
This architecture leverages micro frontends and microservices to create a scalable, modular, and maintainable application. Each service and frontend component is developed, deployed, and managed independently, ensuring flexibility and ease of updates.

# Microservices Architecture

 
## Backend Services
User Service: Manages user authentication and profiles.
Technologies: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
Product Service: Handles product catalog and CRUD operations.
Technologies: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
Order Service: Manages orders and transactions.
Technologies: Node.js, Express, MySQL
Notification Service: Manages email and SMS notifications.
Technologies: Node.js, NestJS, Redis
Communication
API Gateway: Serves as the single entry point for all microservices.
Technologies: Nginx
Message Broker: Facilitates inter-service communication.
Technologies: RabbitMQ or Kafka

# Micro Frontends Architecture


## Frontend Applications
Main App: Handles server-side rendering and integrates other micro frontends.
Technologies: Next.js (React)
User Dashboard: Manages user-specific actions and data.
Technologies: Angular
Product Catalog: Displays and manages products.
Technologies: Vue.js
Order Management: Handles order-related actions.
Technologies: Solid.js
State Management
Central Store: Manages global state across all micro frontends.
Technologies: Redux Toolkit
4. Deployment and DevOps
Containerization
Docker: Containerizes all services and frontend applications.
Docker Hub: Repository for storing and sharing Docker images.
Orchestration
Kubernetes: Manages deployment, scaling, and networking of containers.
CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions: Automates testing, building, and deployment.

# Additional Technologies
Caching: Redis for improving performance by caching frequently accessed data.
Collaboration Tools: Jira, Trello, Confluence for project management and documentation.
Web Security: Implement web security measures to ensure data protection.

# Deployment Pipeline

Code Repository: Host source code on GitHub.
Containerization: Use Docker to create images for each service and frontend.
CI/CD Pipeline: Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
Orchestration and Deployment: Use Kubernetes for deploying and managing containers.
API Gateway: Configure Nginx for routing requests to appropriate services.
Main App (SSR): Use Next.js for server-side rendering and better SEO.
Integrate Micro Frontends: Integrate Angular, Vue.js, and Solid.js applications into the main app.
State Management: Use Redux Toolkit to manage state across micro frontends.
